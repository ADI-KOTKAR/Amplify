There are many great applications available on GitHub, however, this can be counted as one them.We wanted to create a application just so amazing that it'll be same as spotify but with python and firebase which is hell of a task.

Here's why:
* We needed hands on practice on python.
* We wanted to get an idea of creating open-source projects. /play heygirl
* We wanted to explore about the Firebase and online streaming content. :smile:



A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

I am only listing the main things which are needed for this rest you can see inside the requirements.txt

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/)
* [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

First of all you will need a database of your own which should be created in firebase , we created out database with cloud-firestore you can use whichever database you want, we recommend Firestore.
This the Database structure.
```
[
  Tracks : [
    {
      "Language" :  (String),
      "artist" : (String),
      "genre" : (String),
      "like_count" : (Integer),
      "location" : (String [ Url of the track ]),
      "title" : (String)
     }
  ],
  artist : [
    {
      "name" : (String),
      "image_url" : (String [ Url of the image ]),
    } 
  ],
  genres : [
    {
      "genre_name" : (String),
      "genre_image" : (String [ Url of the image ]),
    } 
  ],
  languages : [
    {
      "language_name" : (String),
      "language_image" : (String [ Url of the image ]),
    } 
  ],
  users : [
    Liked_songs : [
      Track_object
      (as mentioned above)
     ]
    {
      "display_name" : (String),
      "email" : (String),
      "email_verified : (boolean),
      "password" : (String),
      "verification_code" : (String),
    }
  ]
]




```
After this add Data to your database and then integrate your database with by service_key.json generated by Firebase.

Post this you need to run the following command in the same directory in the Treminal or command prompt.
```py
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you have made it so far then you are genius enough to make your won application.
Now run 
```py
python main.py 
```
and ka-boom!! :clap:
